# ToDoList (2024.02.01~02.25)

### Tech Stack: React.js

This project was developed using React.js and submitted for the Google Solution Challenge 2024. It was my first experience working on a team project.

### Challenges

- Since all team members were beginners, it was difficult to determine which features were feasible and which were not.

### Solutions & Limitations

- With advice from the GDSC Lead, we focused on completing the project within the deadline, aiming for a functional and presentable submission.
- I relied heavily on another team member who was also a frontend developer.

### Reflections & Future Goals

- CodeSandbox is a surprisingly good online editor.
- I realized that setting challenging goals keeps me more motivated.
- After working on this team project, Iâ€™ve become interested in becoming a full-stack developer. Having a broad understanding of all areas seems like it would provide a valuable perspective.
